# Keyboard FSM stuff

Ideally this'll be some no_std FSM library for handling the state of a keyboard.

My main goals are for supporting layers, [mod
taps](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/mod_tap.md)
and[combos](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_combo.md)
